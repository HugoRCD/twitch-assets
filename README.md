## ✨ Why Nuxt for Twitch Assets?

You might not think of Nuxt when planning your stream visuals, but it offers some incredible advantages:

*   **Full Creative Control:** Leverage the power of Vue components and modern web technologies to create truly unique and interactive assets.
*   **Dynamic Content:** Easily integrate real-time data, APIs, or even server-side logic with Nitro.
*   **Reactivity:** Vue's reactivity makes for smooth and responsive overlays that can react to stream events.
*   **Familiar Workflow:** If you're a web developer, you're already in your comfort zone!
*   **Open Source & Customizable:** This repo serves as a live example. Fork it, learn from it, and adapt it for your own stream!

## 🚀 What's Inside?

This repository showcases how I'm using Nuxt to power various elements of my stream, including (but not limited to):

*   🖼️ **Stream Screens:** Starting Soon, Be Right Back, Stream Ending overlays.
*   💬 **Interactive Elements:** (e.g., chat display, follower alerts - if you implement them)
*   📊 **Dynamic Information:** (e.g., current project, music, social media handles)
*   🎨 **Custom Styling:** All styled with [Your CSS Solution, e.g., Tailwind CSS].

This is a living project, and I'll be adding more as I develop my stream!

## 🔧 How It Works (High-Level)

Each asset or overlay is typically a Nuxt route or component. These are then added as **Browser Sources** in my streaming software (like OBS Studio or Streamlabs). Nuxt handles the rendering, animations, and dynamic updates.

The goal is to show that you can build sophisticated and professional-looking stream assets using the tools you already know as a web developer.

## 💡 Get Inspired!

Feel free to browse the code, see how things are structured, and get inspired to build your own Nuxt-powered stream assets. You might be surprised by what's possible!

While this project hosts *my* personal assets, the patterns and techniques can be adapted for any stream.

## 🤝 Contributing & Feedback

This is primarily a showcase of my personal setup, but if you have cool ideas, find bugs in how I've implemented something, or want to share how you've adapted this, feel free to open an issue or discussion!

And if you find this inspiring, a star ⭐ on the repo is always appreciated!
